# Mr. Float Logistics

**High-Performance Landing Page & WhatsApp Booking System**

## 📌 Project Overview
**Mr. Float Logistics** is a leading transport and logistics provider in Zimbabwe, offering services ranging from taxi rides and airport shuttles to long-distance travel and package deliveries.

Despite their strong local reputation, they lacked a centralized digital presence. Customer inquiries were scattered across social media, and booking a service was a friction-filled process involving phone tag and lost messages.

**LMWebDesign** built a fast, mobile-optimized landing page designed to do one thing exceptionally well: **funnel six diverse transport services directly into a streamlined WhatsApp booking system.**

## 🚀 The Challenge
1.  **Scattered Communication:** Potential customers had to hunt through social media posts just to find a phone number, killing conversions.
2.  **No Digital Hub:** There was no single place to see all services, compare options, or make a booking, leading to dozens of lost leads daily.
3.  **Invisible to Search:** Without a website, Mr. Float was missing out on the growing volume of searches for "transport service Zimbabwe" or "car hire Harare."
4.  **Data Constraints:** The majority of users in Zimbabwe access the web on budget smartphones with expensive, often slow (3G) data connections.

## 💡 The Solution
We moved beyond a standard brochure site and built a **conversion engine**:

*   **Unified Service Hub:** All six services (Taxi, Car Hire, Airport Shuttle, etc.) are clearly presented in one polished interface.
*   **Zero-Friction WhatsApp Booking:** We designed a flow where every service has a dedicated Call-to-Action. Tapping "Book Now" opens a **pre-formatted WhatsApp message** (e.g., "Hi, I'd like to book an airport shuttle..."). The customer never has to type an explanation; the system handles context automatically.
*   **Extreme Mobile Optimization:** Knowing the target market, we optimized every asset for **sub-second load times on 3G networks**.

*   **Mobile-First Architecture:** A lightning-fast interface designed for "thumb-friendly" navigation.
